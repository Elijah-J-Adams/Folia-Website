  "By the time of the SkillsUSA competition Asa and I would like to have between 3 and 6 fully completed levels, Our goal is to be able to run out at least 10 full minutes of gameplay for the demo version of our game, as well as trying to patch out and complete any bugs that have been found or will be found up until the competition. Constant maintenence is one of our neccersary goals, due to the constanlty changing factor of the game being in VR."
