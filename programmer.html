<p>"Ever since I was in 6th grade Iâ€™ve had an interest in gaming and game design. I created my first game with one of my friends when I was 12 for a school project and have liked it ever since. I would like to get into the Champlain College for the Game Design degree they offer. After college I would preferably like to start my own game company, or work at one of the big triple A studios."
